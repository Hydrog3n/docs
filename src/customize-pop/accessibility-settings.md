### Zoom

The `Zoom` setting designates all or a part of the screen to display magnified content. The magnified area tracks with the movement of the mouse. This feature can be further customized to zoom specific portions of the screen, increase or decrease the zoom magnification, adding a crosshair, and adding color effects to the zoomed area.
