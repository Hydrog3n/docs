# Typing

Typing accessibility features enhance keyboard input behavior.

## Screen Keyboard

Enabling `Screen Keyboard` will display an interactive keyboard wherever text entry is possible.

## Repeat Keys

Enabling `Repeat Keys` causes key inputs to repeat when a key is held down. Users can configure the delay before this actions occurs, and the repeat speed once the action occurs. Disabling `Repeat Keys` causes every key press to render as a single input.

## Cursor Blinking

When `Cursor Blinking` is enabled, the cursor will blink when a text field is selected. Users can also adjust the blink speed.

## Typing Assist

`Typing Assist` settings modify the way a keyboard accepts input from the user.

| Option | Function |
|--------|--------|
| Sticky Keys | Perform multi-key shortcuts by pressing keys individually instead of holding down multiple keys simultaneously. |
| Slow Keys | Increase the delay between the time a key is pressed and when it appears on the screen. |
| Bounce Keys | Ignore subsequent key presses if they occur too quickly on the same key. |
