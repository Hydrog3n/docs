# GNOME Shell Extensions

GNOME Shell extensions are features written by third party developers that build upon the GNOME Shell. Extensions are similar to Chrome Extensions or Firefox Addons.

- **GNOME Extensions** is an official GNOME application for managing these extensions.
- **Extension Manager** is a utility for browsing and installing extensions. While this is not an official GNOME application, it is [supported by the GNOME team](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/merge_requests/2358).

Both applications provide menus for configuring, disabling, or removing installed extensions.

## Installing the GNOME Extensions & Extension Manager Apps

GNOME Extensions is installed by default in Pop!\_OS, but if it is removed it can be reinstalled using the Pop!\_Shop. The GNOME Extension Manager is not installed by default. To install either of these applications, launch the Pop!\_Shop and type `extensions`, then click `Install` for each application.
