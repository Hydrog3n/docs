# GNOME Shell Extensions

GNOME shell extensions are features written by third party developers that build upon the GNOME Shell. Extensions are similar to Chrome Extensions or Firefox Addons.

- **GNOME Extensions** is an application for managing these extensions.
- **Extension Manager** is a utility for browsing and installing extensions.

Both applications provide menus for configuring, disabling, or removing installed extensions.
