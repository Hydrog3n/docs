# GNOME Tweaks & Extensions

GNOME Tweaks and GNOME Shell Extensions provide additional customization beyond the `Settings` menu.

- [Fine Tune the Desktop Experience Beyond the Settings Menu](gnome-tweaks.md) - Configure advanced options for appearance, fonts, keyboard & mouse input, and application windows.
- [Add Functionality to Pop!_OS](gnome-extensions.md) - Use GNOME Extensions and GNOME Extensions Manager to install and manage applications that add features and improve productivity.
- [Change the Entire Desktop UI](user-themes.md) - Use GNOME Tweaks and Extensions to change default theme elements such as window design, animations, color schemes, icons and workspaces. Or, revert the desktop theme back to Pop!\_OS defaults.
