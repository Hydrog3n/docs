# Online Accounts

Settings to connect online accounts are located in `Settings` âžž `Online Accounts`. These settings provide single sign-on for online providers. Connected accounts can directly access services like Mail, Calendar, Contacts, Maps, Photos, Files, and Music, without requiring sign-on through a web browser.
