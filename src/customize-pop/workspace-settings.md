## Dynamic Workspaces

Automatically remove workspaces when they contain no active windows, and automatically generate new workspaces when a window is dragged to the next lowest workspace.

### Fixed Number of Workspaces

Specify a static number of workspaces.

### Multi-monitor Behavior

#### Workspaces Span Displays (Default)

All connected displays are treated as one desktop. Windows/Applications can be moved between displays without being moved to another workspace. Switching to a workspace above or below switches all monitors to the next workspace.

#### Workspaces on Primary Displays Only

Workspace navigation only affects the monitor set as the primary display. Switching workspaces leaves applications/windows on secondary displays in view.

### Placement of the Workspace Picker

Specify whether the workspace picker appears along the left or right side of the screen.
